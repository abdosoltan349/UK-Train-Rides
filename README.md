## 📖 About the Project

The UK train network is a web of bustling activity. Millions of passengers traverse its lines daily, creating a treasure trove of data. This project dives into that data to answer questions like:

- 🚉 Which routes are the busiest?
- ⏰ When do people travel the most?
- 💷 How do ticket prices vary?
- ❌ What impact do delays have on travel behavior?

By the end, we aim to deliver insights that enhance passenger experience and guide transportation strategies.
